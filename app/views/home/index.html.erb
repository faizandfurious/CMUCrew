    <h5>Tartan Crew is on Summer Break (but don't think we're on vacation)</h5></br>        
    Our team is rigorously preparing for the upcoming Fall season. In fact we have some rowers still in Pittsburgh, rowing multiple times a week with the Three Rivers Rowing Assocations' Masters Men and Masters Women. We also have rowers practicing with prestigious crews out in Philadelphia. Our other members are in various parts of the country (and world!) preparing for the Fall.

    And we're happy to announce that we have two members participating in the LiveSTRONG Challenge alongside several CMU Crew alumni in Philadelphia.
